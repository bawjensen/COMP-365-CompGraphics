# COMP-365: Computer Graphics

This repository contains all of my work for the Spring 2014 course of Computer Graphics. Many of these projects were done together with [Devin Delfino](https://github.com/devindelfino) (Wheaton College, class of 2015). The folders each contain one of our project assignments, with other folders for work done in class, and others.
